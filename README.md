CS465 Full Stack Development I

Architecture

In this project, I used HTML and JS via Express and Angular as the frontend architectures. On the customer-facing side, HTML documents were created with JavaScript to display the data and it was served by Express. Using an MVC architecture multiple pages were loaded one at a time. On the admin-facing side, Angular was used, however, multiple components were created and loaded programmatically within the same HTML document. These components were preloaded, and this provided a seamless experience for the admins. In the backend, MongoDB was utilized, and a NoSQL database was used too that worked with Node.JS.

Functionality

In this project, JSON was used to store and display data. JSON can be used with a variety of programming languages. On the other hand, JavaScript is a programming language, and it uses JSON to define objects. The frontend and backend are tied together with the use of JSON and APIs.
	One example where functionality was improved by refactoring a code was replacing some of the static HTML pages with templates utilizing Handlebars. Using Handlebars allowed the structure of a page to be reused and to change the content that was displayed. Also, Angular is very efficient in its use of components, meaning that we can use the child componentl ike template. This is really helpful because it allows us to reuse it and keep the code clean.

Testing 

The HTTP methods are different types of interaction that the client can have with the server. The most common HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Also, the API endpoints are how the client communicates with the server using the HTTP methods. In this full stack application, the security consisted of authenticating the user and utilizing encrypted passwords in the admin side. Also, it is very important for security, to check the adminâ€™s permissions before permitting them to perform certain actions.

Reflection

This course was really interesting and helped me learn about full stack development and enjoy the process of learning. Having to learn so many different frameworks and stacks that can be used I appreciated that this course allowed me to focus on one stack to complete the project. Doing this helped me polish my skills and learn a library and framework. I also polished my skills and understanding of Node.JS, MongoDB, Express and how they can interact with each other to complete a full stack application.
